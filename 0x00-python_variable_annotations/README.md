In Python 3, type annotations do not change this. Python is still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

- Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
- Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.

## Objectives

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy


## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.7)`
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A __README.md file__, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c '`print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
